# Breakout-Game



This was a first year project to write something using the C language and SDL2. 
Its a classic breakout game where you have to break all the blocks to move onto the next level.

It has working life, death, respawn, score system, and game-over functions. Added music and sound FX on most objects.

Also randomly spawns power ups like extra ball and lasers.
